# Team Review — Analyze Learnings & Propose Improvements

Analyze accumulated Dream Team session data (retro learnings, history, journals) to identify patterns, flag problems, and propose concrete improvements to the team workflow.

## Data Sources

Read these files (skip any that don't exist yet):

1. **Session history**: Look for `dream-team-history.json` in your project memory directory (`~/.claude/projects/*/memory/`)
   - Team sizing decisions and verdicts (good / over-spawned / under-spawned)
   - Complexity ratings, review rounds, must-fix counts
   - Journal highlights from each session
   - Achievement distribution

2. **Retro learnings**: Look for `dream-team-learnings.md` in the same project memory directory
   - Applied and deferred command file changes per session
   - Doc gaps found
   - Process notes

3. **Current command file**: `~/.claude/commands/my-dream-team.md`
   - To cross-reference whether past learnings have been addressed

## Analysis

If there are fewer than 2 sessions recorded, tell the user there isn't enough data yet and show what data will be collected after more sessions.

Otherwise, analyze across all sessions and produce a report:

```
## Dream Team Health Report

### Sessions Analyzed
[N sessions from DATE to DATE]

### Team Sizing Patterns
- Average team size: [N agents]
- Over-spawned: [N times] — [pattern description]
- Under-spawned: [N times] — [pattern description]
- **Recommendation**: [e.g., "Amara tends to over-spawn for frontend-only tickets — consider adding a rule to cap at 1 frontend dev for tickets under medium complexity"]

### Recurring Instruction Gaps
[Group journal highlights by category. If the same issue appears 2+ times, flag it.]
- **Repeated issue**: [description] — appeared in [N] sessions
- **Proposed fix**: [specific change to agent prompt in my-dream-team.md]

### Communication & Coordination
- Average review rounds: [N]
- Sessions with blocked agents: [N]
- Communication friction patterns: [from journal highlights]
- **Recommendation**: [e.g., "Kenji frequently waits for API contract details — consider having Amara provide a more detailed contract template"]

### Convention & Doc Gaps
[Recurring doc issues from retro learnings]
- [doc file]: [issue] — reported [N] times
- **Action**: [fix the doc / update agent instructions / add to conventions summary]

### Deferred Changes
[List changes from past retros that were saved but never applied]
- From [date] session: [change description]
- **Still relevant?** [yes/no based on current command file]

### Achievement Trends
- Most common: [achievement] ([N] times)
- Rarest: [achievement] ([N] times)
- Agents with no achievements yet: [names]

### Overall Health Score
Rate the team on these dimensions (1-5):
- **Instruction quality**: Are agent prompts giving them what they need?
- **Team sizing accuracy**: Is Amara calibrating well?
- **Communication flow**: Are agents coordinating without friction?
- **Review efficiency**: Are reviews catching real issues without excessive rounds?
- **Context efficiency**: Are agents staying within context limits?
```

## Learning Router

After the health report, route deferred learnings to the right destination files. This is the key value of `/team-review` — learnings don't just sit in a markdown file, they get applied where they'll actually help.

### Destination Registry

| ID | Destination | Path | Scope |
|----|-------------|------|-------|
| `dream-team` | Dream Team command | `~/.claude/commands/my-dream-team.md` | Agent prompts, phases, process |
| `agent:<name>` | Standalone agent | `~/.claude/agents/<name>.md` | Agent behavior outside Dream Team |
| `skill:<name>` | Skill/command | `~/.claude/commands/<name>.md` | Skill-specific checklist or workflow |
| `project-claude` | Project CLAUDE.md | `<monorepo>/CLAUDE.md` | Monorepo quick-start info only (NOT conventions — use repo-docs for those) |
| `agents-md:<path>` | Repo AGENTS.md | `<monorepo>/<path>` | Agent-specific operational gotchas only (commands, auth, db names, ports) |
| `global-claude` | Global CLAUDE.md | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Every Claude session everywhere |
| `repo-docs` | Repo docs | `docs/<file>.md` | Team-wide coding standards and conventions |
| `memory` | Memory file | Project memory directory | Notes for future reference only |

### Repo File Decision Tree (Repo)

**Always read the target file before proposing a change.** Use this decision tree to pick the right file — wrong placement has happened before (learnings routed to `AGENTS.md` that belonged in style guide docs).

**Is it a convention/pattern a developer should follow when writing code?**
- Frontend component pattern, React hook usage, routing, lazy-loading, TypeScript → `repo-docs:docs/CODING_STYLE_FRONTEND.md`
- Tailwind classes, color tokens, breakpoints, twMerge, CVA → `repo-docs:docs/TAILWIND_CONVENTIONS.md`
- Backend C# pattern, domain modelling, EF Core, enum design, DI, error handling → `repo-docs:docs/CODING_STYLE_BACKEND.md`
- API endpoint conventions, response shape, versioning, auth attributes → `repo-docs:docs/API_CONVENTIONS.md`
- i18n, translation keys, TranslationService workflow, defaultValue pattern → `repo-docs:docs/INTERNATIONALIZATION.md`
- Route URL paths, page name → full URL mapping → `repo-docs:docs/APP_SITEMAP.md`
- Frontend component library patterns (CVA, Radix, design tokens) → `repo-docs:docs/FRONTEND_COMPONENTS.md`
- Backend testing patterns, unit/integration test conventions → `repo-docs:docs/TESTING_GUIDELINES_BACKEND.md`

**Is it a service-specific operational gotcha** (not a coding convention — something you need to *run* or *operate*)?
- Database names for psql, service ports, Docker quirks, seed data gaps for a specific service → `agents-md:services/<SVC>/AGENTS.md` (e.g. `services/ServiceB/AGENTS.md`)
- Cross-service operational gotchas (auth script, local dev login, worktree ServiceC swap) → `agents-md:services/AGENTS.md`
- Frontend agent commands, quick-ref for running/building the web app → `agents-md:apps/web/AGENTS.md`

> ⚠️ **`apps/web/AGENTS.md` and `services/AGENTS.md` are NOT for coding conventions.** They are for quick-reference commands and agent-specific operational gotchas. If you catch yourself writing "use X pattern instead of Y" in an AGENTS.md, it belongs in a style guide doc instead.

**Is it monorepo-wide infrastructure/structure info** (project layout, docker compose, quick-start)?
→ `project-claude` (`CLAUDE.md` at repo root or `services/CLAUDE.md`)

> ⚠️ **`CLAUDE.md` is NOT for coding conventions either.** It's a quick-start reference for the repo structure and how to run things. Conventions go in `docs/`.

**Does it affect Dream Team agent behavior** (prompts, phases, coordination)?
→ `dream-team`

**Does it affect a standalone agent** (architect, backend-dev, etc.) outside Dream Team?
→ `agent:<name>`

**Is it general knowledge** not actionable as a shared rule?
→ `memory`

### Classification Rules (summary)

| Learning type | Correct destination |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Agent coordination, timing, prompting, phases | `dream-team` |
| Frontend coding pattern or convention | `repo-docs:docs/CODING_STYLE_FRONTEND.md` |
| Tailwind/styling convention | `repo-docs:docs/TAILWIND_CONVENTIONS.md` |
| Backend coding pattern or convention | `repo-docs:docs/CODING_STYLE_BACKEND.md` |
| API design convention | `repo-docs:docs/API_CONVENTIONS.md` |
| i18n / translation workflow | `repo-docs:docs/INTERNATIONALIZATION.md` |
| Route URL reference | `repo-docs:docs/APP_SITEMAP.md` |
| Service-specific operational gotcha | `agents-md:services/<SVC>/AGENTS.md` |
| Cross-service operational gotcha | `agents-md:services/AGENTS.md` |
| Frontend agent commands/quick-ref | `agents-md:apps/web/AGENTS.md` |
| Monorepo structure/quick-start | `project-claude` |
| Standalone agent behavior (outside Dream Team) | `agent:<name>` |
| Skill workflow improvement | `skill:<name>` |
| General knowledge, no actionable rule | `memory` |

A single learning can route to **multiple destinations** (e.g., "check API endpoints" → both `agent:architect` and `skill:review-pr`).

### Apply Modes: Direct vs Ticket+PR

Learnings split into two tracks based on who they affect:

**Direct apply** (personal config in `~/.claude/`, only affects you):
- `dream-team`, `agent:<name>`, `skill:<name>`, `global-claude`, `memory`
- These are edited immediately and synced with `/sync-config`

**Ticket + PR** (shared repo files, affects the whole team):
- `project-claude`, `agents-md:<path>`, `repo-docs`
- These are NOT written directly. Instead:
  1. Group all repo-bound learnings into a single Jira ticket
  2. Create a branch + PR with the proposed changes
  3. The team reviews the PR like any other code change

### Routing Workflow

1. **Scan** all "Deferred" items from `dream-team-learnings.md` that aren't struck through (`~~`). Also check items with destination hints from recent retros.

2. **Classify** each using the Repo File Decision Tree above. If the retro already tagged a destination hint, use it as a **starting point only** — verify it's correct using the decision tree. Retro destination hints are often wrong (e.g., coding conventions tagged as `agents-md:apps/web/AGENTS.md` when they belong in `docs/CODING_STYLE_FRONTEND.md`).

3. **Read each destination file** before proposing changes — understand what's already there so you add to the right section and avoid duplicates. Pay attention to the file's purpose: if it's a style guide, add to a relevant existing section. If it's an AGENTS.md, only add operational/command content — never coding conventions.

4. **Present the routing table** to the user, with the apply mode column:

   ```
   ## Learning Router — Proposed Destinations

   ### Direct Apply (personal config)
   | # | Learning | Source Session | Destination | File | Proposed Change |
   |---|---------|---------------|-------------|------|-----------------|
   | 1 | Kenji shares contracts late | PROJ-1359 | dream-team | my-dream-team.md | Add timing instruction to Kenji prompt |
   | 2 | Check API endpoints exist | PROJ-1562 | agent:architect + skill:review-pr | architect.md, review-pr.md | Add checklist item |
   | 3 | Theme token colors unreliable | PROJ-1569 | memory | ticket-patterns.md | Note only — convention goes to repo-docs |

   ### Ticket + PR (shared repo — needs team review)
   | # | Learning | Source Session | Destination | File | Proposed Change |
   |---|---------|---------------|-------------|------|-----------------|
   | 4 | Use Dapper for heavy SQL | PROJ-1359 | repo-docs | docs/CODING_STYLE_BACKEND.md | Add to DB / query section |
   | 5 | ServiceB soft-delete quirk | PROJ-1359 | agents-md:services/ServiceB | services/ServiceB/AGENTS.md | Add Known Issues section |
   | 6 | Date helper convention | PROJ-1692 | repo-docs | docs/CODING_STYLE_FRONTEND.md | Add date parsing section |
   | 7 | Theme token colors unreliable | PROJ-1569 | repo-docs | docs/TAILWIND_CONVENTIONS.md | Add warning next to token listing |

   ### No Route (already addressed or no longer relevant)
   - [item] — [reason it's skipped]
   ```

5. **Ask the user** to approve routing using AskUserQuestion:
   - "Route all" — Apply direct items + create ticket/PR for repo items
   - "Let me pick" — User selects which rows to apply
   - "Save routing plan only" — Record the proposed routing in learnings file without applying
   - "Skip routing"

6. **Apply direct items** to personal config files. For each:
   - Read the file first
   - Find the appropriate section (or create one like `## Learned Conventions` or `## Known Issues`)
   - Add the learning concisely — match the existing style of the file
   - Don't restructure the file, just append to the right section
   - After all direct items are applied, offer to run `/sync-config`

7. **Create ticket + PR for repo items**. If there are any repo-bound learnings:

   a. **Create a Jira ticket** with `acli`:
      ```bash
      acli jira workitem create --project PLRS --type Uppgift \
        --summary "Apply retro learnings to repo docs and conventions" \
        --description "<description with the table of proposed changes>"
      ```
      Check allowed issue types first if the create fails: `acli jira workitem create --help` or try `Task`, `Uppgift`, or `Story` depending on your project's config. If `acli` is unavailable, tell the user the ticket details to create manually.

   b. **Create a branch and PR** using `/workspace-launch` or manually:
      ```bash
      cd <monorepo>
      git checkout -b retro-learnings-<date>
      ```

   c. **Apply the repo changes** to the branch:
      - Edit each destination file (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, docs/*.md)
      - Commit with message referencing the Jira ticket

   d. **Create a draft PR**:
      ```bash
      gh pr create --draft --title "PROJ-XXXX: Apply retro learnings to repo conventions" \
        --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
      ## Summary
      Applies learnings from Dream Team retrospectives to shared repo files.

      ## Changes
      [table of changes from the routing table]

      ## Source Sessions
      [list of session IDs these learnings came from]
      EOF
      )"
      ```

   e. **Report** the Jira ticket ID and PR URL to the user.

8. **Mark applied/ticketed items** in `dream-team-learnings.md`:
   - Direct items: `- ~~[description]~~ → Applied to [destination] on [date]`
   - Repo items: `- ~~[description]~~ → Ticketed as [PROJ-XXXX] / PR #[number] on [date]`
   - This prevents re-proposing already-handled learnings in future reviews

## Actions

After presenting the health report AND the routing table, ask the user:

- "Apply health report changes + route learnings" — Do both: edit `my-dream-team.md` with health report fixes AND run the full routing (direct apply + ticket/PR)
- "Apply health report changes only" — Only the `my-dream-team.md` changes (legacy behavior)
- "Route learnings only" — Skip health report changes, just run the routing
- "Save report" — Append the report to `dream-team-learnings.md` under a `## Team Review: [date]` heading
- "Skip"

## Tips

- Run this periodically (e.g., every 5-10 sessions) to keep the team calibrated
- The report gets more useful with more data — early sessions may not show clear patterns
- Focus on **recurring** issues, not one-off problems
- The Learning Router is most valuable after 3+ sessions — that's when deferred learnings pile up
- Learnings routed to `project-claude` or `agents-md` help ALL Claude sessions, not just Dream Team — this is how lite-mode and raw Claude sessions benefit from Dream Team retros
- Repo-bound learnings go through PR review so the whole team can weigh in — this prevents one person's retro from silently changing shared conventions
