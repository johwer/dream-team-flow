## Why DTF?

Claude Code is powerful out of the box. But running it on real tickets across a team exposes three gaps:

1. **No memory between sessions.** Claude makes the same mistakes twice. Your conventions live in your head, not in the system.
2. **No structure at scale.** Running 5 tickets in parallel with raw Claude means 5 sessions that don't coordinate, don't share learnings, and burn tokens on work that should be deterministic.
3. **No guardrails you can trust.** Claude can ignore a CLAUDE.md instruction. It can skip a step. When agents run unattended, "best effort" isn't enough.

Dream Team Flow fills these gaps with **a flow that learns, scales, and enforces** — built entirely on Claude Code's native architecture (subagents, hooks, tasks, structured tool use). No wrappers, no middleware, no vendor lock-in.

**The flow is the product, not the agents.** Agents are interchangeable. What compounds over time is the orchestration (triage → hydrate → implement → verify → ship), the quality gates (hooks that can't be bypassed), and the learning loops (hooks capture → analyze → promote → skills, conventions, scripts, or memory).

**Every session makes the next one better.** 6 learning paths feed improvements back automatically. The same mistake never happens twice.

**The user stays in control.** Early triage before tokens are spent. Draft PRs. Human-in-the-loop at every gate. AI proposes, human disposes.

### [Self-learning — the same mistake never happens twice](#adapt-to-your-codebase)

Hooks capture data automatically. 6 learning paths feed improvements back into agent prompts, coding style docs, and pre-hydrated context:

| Path | Source | Destination |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Session retros | Agents reflect after every ticket | Agent prompts, conventions |
| PR review mining | Patterns from merged PR feedback | Convention updates, review templates |
| Jira pushback | AI reviewer comment analysis | Ticket triage rules |
| Tool usage patterns | `hooks capture → analyze → promote` | Skills, conventions, scripts, or memory |
| Research & reading | Articles, docs, best-practice guides | Backend/frontend conventions |
| Cross-session analysis | Pattern detection across all retros | Process improvements |

Agents that just know "React + .NET" produce generic code. Agents that know **your** serialization gotchas, **your** idempotency rules, **your** permission model produce code that passes review on the first try.

### [Parallel everything — your review capacity is the bottleneck, not code](docs/parallel.md)

Run as many tickets simultaneously as you want. Each ticket gets its own git worktree, its own Docker containers with isolated ports, and its own agent team — completely independent, zero conflicts. Backend and frontend agents work in parallel within each ticket via a shared API contract. Pause overnight, resume the next day from disk — zero token cost between sessions.

### [Lean by design — cut your AI spend, not your output](docs/token-efficiency.md)

| What | How | Tokens saved |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Formatting, linting, builds | `quality-gate.sh` (shell script) | 100% — zero LLM tokens |
| Early triage | User decides GO/SKIP before agents run | 100% on skipped tickets |
| Pre-hydration | Budget-capped at 30 tool uses per ticket | ~50% vs uncapped |
| Hidden reasoning | `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS: 16000` | ~70% reduction |
| Context management | Strategic compaction at phase boundaries | Prevents quality degradation |
| Cost visibility | `cost-tracker.sh` + `phase-cost-tracker.sh` | Know exactly where tokens go |
| Mode routing | Full team / lite / local per ticket | Trivial tickets cost near zero |

### [Built for teams — onboard in minutes, not days](docs/built-for-teams.md)

One command to install, role-based setup, customizable workflow steps. `company-config.json` auto-configures service names, Jira domain, paths, and role definitions. 12 roles: Developer (Frontend/Backend/Fullstack), Data Engineer, Data Analyst, Infra/DevOps, QA/Tester, UAT Stakeholder, Product Owner, Sales, Marketing, Customer Operations. Each role gets tailored agents, skills, and default workflow steps. `dtf configure` lets existing users add their role anytime. `dtf steps` manages personal workflow steps (automated checks + reminders).

### [Secure by default — compliance without slowing down](SECURITY.md)

Every PR gets a 7-category OWASP security scan before it reaches a human reviewer. Schema changes require Mermaid diagrams and explicit human approval — agents cannot autonomously change your data model. Quality hooks physically prevent agents from skipping steps.

Three-tier permission ladder — personal sandbox, shared standards, team-enforced lockdown. For regulated industries, security review and change governance are built into the pipeline, not bolted on after.

### [Code review that filters its own false positives](docs/review-modes.md)

Most AI code review produces a wall of findings — some real, some noise. DTF's `/review-pr --deep` solves this:

1. **4 parallel agents** review the PR (2x convention on Sonnet, 2x bug/security on Opus)
2. **Every finding gets independently verified** by a fresh validation agent
3. **Only confirmed issues reach you** — false positives are silently filtered out

Three depth levels: **fast** (API-only, seconds), **full** (local builds), **deep** (multi-agent + validation). Combine `--deep --full` for maximum thoroughness.

---

## Repository Architecture

Dream Team Flow is split across three repos:

| Repo | Visibility | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **[dream-team-flow](https://github.com/johwer/dream-team-flow)** | Public | This repo — DTF documentation, improvement plan, `dtf` CLI, company config templates |
| **[marketplace](https://github.com/johwer/marketplace)** | Public | Plugin marketplace — all commands, agents, scripts, hooks, and docs (sanitized) |
| **marketplace-private** | Private | Same plugin files, unsanitized — for team use without de-sanitization |

**Why the split?**
- **Plugin files** (commands, agents, scripts) live in the marketplace repos so any project can install them via Claude Code's plugin system — not tied to Dream Team Flow specifically
- **DTF docs and CLI** live here — framework documentation, improvement plan, company config templates, setup guides
- **Team members** install from `marketplace-private` (real names, no setup needed). **Community users** install from `marketplace` and run `dtf install --company-config` to de-sanitize

---

## How It Works

```
Ticket → Architect → Parallel Dev → Code Review → Test → PR → Human Review → Ship
```

1. **You say:** [`/create-stories`](docs/commands.md#create-stories) `PROJ-1234 PROJ-1235`
2. **Dream Team does:**
   - Fetches all tickets from Jira and **pre-analyzes them in parallel** (scope, complexity, key files, conventions)
   - Presents a recommendations table — you choose Dream Team, Lite, or Just Worktree per ticket
   - Creates git worktrees, installs deps, writes pre-hydrated context files
   - Opens terminals with Claude Code sessions that start with full context
   - Spawns only the agents each ticket actually needs
   - Implements backend and frontend in parallel using a shared API contract
   - Creates a draft PR so the team can follow progress from the start
   - Runs a deterministic quality gate script (formatting, linting, type checks) before every push
   - Reviews the code for security (OWASP) and conventions
   - Polls AI bots (Gemini, Copilot) and CI — fixes issues with a 2-round cap (escalates to user after)
   - PR stays **draft** until you explicitly confirm — then marks ready and assigns reviewers
   - Moves ticket to Done and cleans up

See **[Workflow Phases](docs/workflow-phases.md)** for detailed flowcharts of full, lite, and local modes.

### Understanding the Building Blocks

DTF is built on Claude Code's 7 instruction delivery mechanisms — each with a specific role. Understanding when to use CLAUDE.md vs Skills vs Commands vs Agents vs Hooks is key to making the system work:

**[Instruction Delivery Guide](docs/instruction-delivery.md)** — How CLAUDE.md, skills, commands, agents, hooks, memory, and plugins work together, when to use each, and common anti-patterns to avoid.

## Features

- **Parallel context pre-hydration** — All tickets analyzed in parallel before sessions start
- **Dynamic team sizing** — Architect spawns only the agents the ticket needs
- **Draft PR from the start** — Created after architecture analysis; stays draft until user explicitly confirms
- **Drift detection** — Build baseline captured before implementation, compared before push — regressions caught locally, not in CI
- **Crash recovery** — Agents write notes to disk; crashed agents respawn with full context
- **Stale worktree cleanup** — Merged/closed PRs detected automatically; orphan worktrees cleaned up before new ones are created
- **Non-destructive PR updates** — PR description edits preserve manually added images and screenshots
- **Jira completion comments** — Ticket creator auto-notified with PR link and summary when work is done
- **Standalone PR review** — `/review-pr` reviews any PR with line-level GitHub comments. Three depth levels: fast (API-only), full (`--full` — local builds/tests), deep (`--deep` — 4 parallel agents + validation pass to eliminate false positives). Combine `--deep --full` for maximum depth
- **Granular task decomposition** — 5-6 small tasks per agent instead of 1-2 big ones — better progress visibility, checkpoint-level quality enforcement, and less work lost on crashes
- **De-sloppify pass** — Cleanup phase before commit: removes over-engineering, dead code, premature abstractions, and defensive bloat that agents naturally introduce
- **Strategic compaction** — Proactive context management with defined compact points at phase boundaries — prevents quality degradation in long sessions
- **Context modes** — Dev/review/research mindsets with distinct priorities and tool preferences — auto-activates for relevant commands
- **Continuous learning from tool usage** — 4th learning path: analyze tool usage patterns, detect context gaps and struggle points, promote to skills/conventions/scripts via `/evolve`
- **Cost tracking** — Session cost reports with relative units per tool, top sessions, and per-session breakdowns
- **Config health scanner** — Security/health scan of your Claude Code configuration (secrets, performance, hygiene) with A-F grading

See **[Features](docs/features.md)** for the full list — team setup, orchestration, review, resilience, and self-learning.

## Quick Start

### Option A: Plugin Install (recommended)

Install the plugin marketplace and the toolkit:

```bash
# Public (community — needs de-sanitization with company config)
/plugin marketplace add johwer/marketplace
/plugin install claude-toolkit@marketplace

# Private (team — ready to use, no de-sanitization needed)
/plugin marketplace add johwer/marketplace-private
/plugin install claude-toolkit@marketplace-private
```

### Option B: DTF CLI Install (full setup with company config)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johwer/dream-team-flow.git
bash dream-team-flow/scripts/dtf.sh install https://github.com/johwer/dream-team-flow
brew install tmux jq
```

Pass a company config for team installs:

```bash
bash dream-team-flow/scripts/dtf.sh install https://github.com/johwer/dream-team-flow \
  --company-config company-config.json
```

### Option C: Both (recommended for teams)

Use the plugin for commands/agents/scripts, and the DTF CLI for company-specific setup:

```bash
# 1. Install plugin (gets all commands, agents, scripts)
/plugin marketplace add johwer/marketplace-private
/plugin install claude-toolkit@marketplace-private

# 2. Run DTF CLI for company config (sets Jira domain, service names, personal config)
bash dream-team-flow/scripts/dtf.sh install https://github.com/johwer/dream-team-flow \
  --company-config company-config.json
```

See **[Installation](docs/installation.md)** for prerequisites, team/enterprise setup, and supported terminals.

## Usage

```
/create-stories PROJ-1234                        # Full lifecycle — ticket to PR
/my-dream-team --lite <ticket>                   # Claude decides agent usage
/review-pr 1670                                  # Review any PR
```

Three modes: **Full** (multi-agent team), **Lite** (Claude decides, same quality gates), and **Local** (no PR/push). Flags like `--no-worktree` and `--local` can be combined. Lite mode includes strategic compaction, context mode switching, and de-sloppify — same quality, fewer agents.

```
bash ~/.claude/scripts/analyze-patterns.sh           # Detect usage patterns
/evolve                                              # Promote patterns to skills/conventions
bash ~/.claude/scripts/cost-tracker.sh report        # Session cost report
bash ~/.claude/scripts/config-scan.sh                # Config health check (A-F)
```

See **[Usage Guide](docs/usage.md)** for all modes, flags, PR review, and reviewer auto-assignment.

## The Team

29 specialized agents across 8 domains — engineering, data, design, infrastructure, marketing, operations, product, and testing. Your role determines which agents load (3-7 per role, not all 29). The architect analyzes each ticket and dynamically spawns only the agents needed.

```
engineering/     (7)  frontend-dev, backend-dev, architect, pr-reviewer,
                      api-designer, performance-analyst, migration-planner
data/            (4)  data-engineer, data-analyst, pipeline-builder, insights-reporter
design/          (2)  ui-designer, ux-researcher
infrastructure/  (3)  infra-engineer, ci-cd-engineer, security-auditor
marketing/       (4)  marketing-ops, sales-enablement, content-creator, social-strategist
operations/      (2)  customer-ops, support-responder
product/         (3)  po-analyst, requirements-analyst, sprint-prioritizer
testing/         (4)  qa-tester, uat-tester, api-tester, performance-benchmarker
```

## Adapt to Your Codebase

Dream Team Flow isn't just configurable — it **learns your codebase** through six learning channels that continuously feed knowledge into agent prompts, coding style docs, and project conventions:

| Channel | Source | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Session retros** | Agents reflect after every ticket | "Handlers should use atomic upserts" |
| **PR review insights** | Patterns from merged PR feedback | "6 PRs had missing i18n — add to quality gate" |
| **Jira pushback scraping** | AI reviewer comment analysis | "Tickets without ACs get 3x more review cycles" |
| **Tool usage patterns** | Behavioral analysis from tool logs | "settings.json read 12x — add to CLAUDE.md" |
| **Research & reading** | Internet articles, docs, best-practice guides | Microservices messaging patterns from an online guide |
| **Cross-session analysis** | Pattern detection across retros | "4 sessions mentioned soft delete confusion" |

Every learning flows to the right destination — agent prompts, coding style docs, pre-hydrated context, or command logic. Both humans and AI agents read the same docs, so knowledge compounds for everyone.

**Example:** Your team reads an article on microservice messaging and extracts key patterns — idempotent handlers, no sync calls from event handlers, transactional outbox. Those learnings become:
- A new section in your backend coding style guide (repo docs, via Jira + PR)
- A critical rule in the backend agent's prompt ("every handler MUST be idempotent")
- Pre-hydrated context for any ticket touching message handlers

New team members inherit **everything** on day one — the accumulated knowledge isn't in someone's head, it's in agent prompts, coding style docs, and context files that every session reads automatically.

Read more: **[Self-Learning System](docs/retrospectives.md)** — all five channels, routing rules, destinations, and the compounding effect.

### Tech Stack

Built for monorepos with:
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, RTK Query
- **Backend:** .NET Web API, Entity Framework Core, C#
- **Infrastructure:** Docker Compose, EF Core Migrations

Agent definitions, coding style docs, and context templates are all customizable — swap in your stack, your conventions, your domain-specific rules.
