> **Beta** — Actively developed and used in production, but expect breaking changes between updates. Feedback and contributions welcome.

**Free, open-source multi-agent orchestration for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). Give it a Jira ticket — get back a production-ready, security-scanned, human-reviewed PR. No MCP servers, no vendor lock-in, no token waste.**

Built on Claude Code's native multi-agent architecture — subagents, hooks, task coordination, structured tool use — following Anthropic's official patterns. No wrappers, no middleware, no abstractions that break on the next update. When Claude Code ships a new feature, Dream Team Flow uses it directly.

### Lean by design — cut your AI spend, not your output
Most AI coding workflows burn tokens fast: MCP servers that inject thousands of schema tokens per call, agents that load entire codebases into context, and retry loops that run until the budget is gone. Dream Team Flow is built the opposite way. Formatting, linting, type checks, and builds run as shell scripts — zero LLM tokens. Agents read only the files they need, write decisions to disk instead of holding them in context, and skip spawning entirely on simple tickets. The result: a full team — architect, backend dev, frontend dev, security reviewer, tester — working in parallel, at a fraction of the context cost. Teams using Dream Team Flow report completing tickets that would otherwise take a full sprint day in under an hour of wall-clock time, while keeping per-ticket API costs predictable.

### Built for teams — onboard in minutes, not days
One command to install, one command to update. Share a `company-config.json` to auto-configure service names, Jira domain, ticket prefixes, and paths — new developers go from zero to shipping PRs in minutes, not days of setup. Every session ends with a structured retrospective: learnings are routed automatically — personal config changes apply immediately, shared conventions go through Jira tickets and PRs for team review. The team gets smarter with every ticket shipped. Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL) with 10 supported terminals.

### Secure by default — compliance without slowing down
Every PR goes through a 7-category OWASP-aligned security scan — injection, auth/authz, data exposure, path traversal, hardcoded secrets, insecure defaults, and XSS — before it ever reaches a human reviewer. No separate security tooling to buy, configure, or maintain. Dream Team Flow ships with a three-tier permission ladder — personal sandbox, shared project standards, and team-enforced lockdown — so you control exactly what agents can read, write, and execute. For regulated industries, this means security review is built into the pipeline, not bolted on after.

## How It Works

```
Ticket → Architect → Parallel Dev → Code Review → Test → PR → Human Review → Ship
```

1. **You say:** [`/create-stories`](docs/commands.md#create-stories) `PROJ-1234 PROJ-1235`
2. **Dream Team does:**
   - Fetches all tickets from Jira and **pre-analyzes them in parallel** (scope, complexity, key files, conventions)
   - Presents a recommendations table — you choose Dream Team, Lite, or Just Worktree per ticket
   - Creates git worktrees, installs deps, writes pre-hydrated context files
   - Opens terminals with Claude Code sessions that start with full context
   - Spawns only the agents each ticket actually needs
   - Implements backend and frontend in parallel using a shared API contract
   - Creates a draft PR so the team can follow progress from the start
   - Runs a deterministic quality gate script (formatting, linting, type checks) before every push
   - Reviews the code for security (OWASP) and conventions
   - Polls AI bots (Gemini, Copilot) and CI — fixes issues with a 2-round cap (escalates to user after)
   - PR stays **draft** until you explicitly confirm — then marks ready and assigns reviewers
   - Moves ticket to Done and cleans up

---

## Features

- **Parallel context pre-hydration** — All tickets analyzed in parallel before sessions start — agents begin with full context instead of exploring from scratch
- **Dynamic team sizing** — Architect spawns only the agents the ticket needs — no wasted capacity
- **Parallel implementation** — Backend and frontend work simultaneously via a shared API contract
- **Deterministic quality gates** — Formatting, linting, and builds run as a shell script before every push — no LLM tokens burned on mechanical checks
- **Draft PR from the start** — Created after architecture analysis; stays draft until user explicitly confirms
- **CI iteration cap** — 2 fix rounds max, then escalate to user — no infinite retry loops
- **Crash recovery** — Agents write working notes to disk; crashed agents respawn with full context from their notes file
- **Self-learning** — Every session ends with a retro that feeds improvements back into agent prompts and project docs
- **Visual verification** — Frontend agents record before/after GIFs via Chrome for UI changes
- **Security-first** — Every PR gets a 6-category OWASP-aligned security scan before it's ever marked ready

See **[Features](docs/features.md)** for the full list — team setup, orchestration, review, resilience, and self-learning.

## Token-Efficient by Design

Most AI coding setups grow expensive fast — MCP servers, large tool schemas, and bloated context windows add up quickly. Dream Team Flow is built differently:

- **No MCP servers** — agents use plain file reads and CLI tools instead of context-heavy server integrations
- **Pre-hydrated context** — `/create-stories` pre-analyzes tickets in parallel before launching sessions; agents start with scope, key files, and conventions already determined — no wasted exploration tokens
- **Deterministic nodes** — formatting, linting, type checks, and builds run as shell scripts (`quality-gate.sh`), not as LLM-reasoned steps
- **Disk-based memory** — agents write decisions and findings to `.dream-team/notes/` on disk and read them back when needed, rather than keeping everything in the context window
- **Targeted reads** — agents use Grep to find what they need rather than loading entire files or docs
- **Lite mode** — for smaller tickets, Claude skips agent spawning entirely and works solo, with no team coordination overhead
- **CI iteration cap** — 2 fix rounds max before escalating to user, preventing infinite token-burning retry loops
- **Dynamic team sizing** — the architect only spawns agents the ticket actually needs; extra agents are never started

The result: multi-agent sessions that stay lean even on large tickets.

## Retrospectives & Learning Router

Every session ends with a team retro. Learnings are tagged with destinations and routed automatically — personal config changes are applied directly, shared repo changes go through Jira ticket + PR for team review.

Read more: **[Retrospectives](docs/retrospectives.md)** — how it works, where learnings go, and the feedback loop.

---

## Security

Every PR goes through a 6-category OWASP-aligned security scan — injection, auth/authz, data exposure, path traversal, hardcoded secrets, and insecure defaults — before it's ever marked ready for human review.

Dream Team Flow itself ships with a three-tier security ladder: personal sandbox defaults, shared project standards, and team-enforced lockdown. Configure once, enforce across your team.

See **[Security Guide](SECURITY.md)** — sandbox configuration, network isolation, deny rules, and bypass mode.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dream-team-flow.git
bash dream-team-flow/scripts/dtf.sh install https://github.com/your-username/dream-team-flow
brew install tmux jq
```

The installer symlinks all commands, agents, and scripts into `~/.claude/` and generates your config. For team installs, pass a `company-config.json` to auto-configure service names, Jira domain, and paths.

See **[Installation](docs/installation.md)** for prerequisites, team/enterprise setup, and supported terminals.

---

## Usage

```
/create-stories PROJ-1234                        # Full lifecycle — ticket to PR
/my-dream-team --lite <ticket>                   # Claude decides agent usage
/review-pr 1670                                  # Review any PR
```

Three modes: **Full** (multi-agent team), **Lite** (Claude decides), and **Local** (no PR/push). Flags like `--no-worktree` and `--local` can be combined.

See **[Usage Guide](docs/usage.md)** for all modes, flags, PR review, and reviewer auto-assignment.

---

## The Team

11 specialized agents — architect, backend/frontend developers, data engineer, infra, reviewer, tester, visual verifier, and summary writer. The architect analyzes each ticket and dynamically spawns only the agents needed: 2-3 for simple changes, the full team for complex multi-service work.

Read more: **[The Team](docs/the-team.md)** — full agent roster, team sizing logic, and agent definitions.

---

## Tech Stack

Built for monorepos with:
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, RTK Query
- **Backend:** .NET Web API, Entity Framework Core, C#
- **Infrastructure:** Docker Compose, EF Core Migrations

The agent prompts reference these technologies, but the framework is adaptable. You can modify the agent definitions in [`commands/my-dream-team.md`](commands/my-dream-team.md) to match your stack.

---

## Project Structure

Commands, agents, scripts, security configs, and docs — all symlinked into `~/.claude/` after install. Updates are instant via `git pull`.

See **[Project Structure](docs/project-structure.md)** for the full annotated file tree.
