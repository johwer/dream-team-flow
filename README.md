> **Beta** — Actively developed and used in production, but expect breaking changes between updates. Feedback and contributions welcome.

**Free, open-source multi-agent orchestration for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). Give it a Jira ticket — get back a production-ready, security-scanned, human-reviewed PR.**

Run tickets in parallel with isolated worktrees and Docker — multiply your team's story output without multiplying headcount. Keep AI costs predictable with shell-based quality gates, disk-based memory, and agents that read only what they need — no MCP servers, no bloated context windows. Onboard new developers in minutes with one install command and shared config. Ship every PR through a 7-category OWASP security scan — built into the pipeline, not bolted on after. Every bug, review comment, and best-practice article feeds back into agent prompts and coding style docs — the same mistake never happens twice.

Built on Claude Code's native multi-agent architecture — subagents, hooks, task coordination, structured tool use — following Anthropic's official patterns. No wrappers, no middleware, no vendor lock-in. When Claude Code ships a new feature, Dream Team Flow uses it directly.

### [Parallel everything — 4x story output or more](docs/parallel.md)

Run 4, 6, 10 tickets simultaneously. Each ticket gets its own git worktree, its own Docker containers with isolated ports, and its own agent team — completely independent, zero conflicts. Backend and frontend agents work in parallel within each ticket via a shared API contract. Pause overnight, resume the next day from disk — zero token cost between sessions.

A single developer can sustain the story output of a 4-person team — or more — because the work happens concurrently, not sequentially.

### [Lean by design — cut your AI spend, not your output](docs/token-efficiency.md)

Each ticket is routed to the right mode — full team, lite, or just a worktree — so trivial tickets cost zero and only complex ones get the full team. Formatting, linting, and builds run as shell scripts — zero LLM tokens. Structured handoff templates eliminate agent back-and-forth. Deadlock detection catches stuck agents at 10 minutes. CI fixes capped at 2 rounds.

Per-ticket API costs stay predictable regardless of complexity.

### [Built for teams — onboard in minutes, not days](docs/built-for-teams.md)

One command to install, one command to update. `company-config.json` auto-configures service names, Jira domain, and paths — new developers ship PRs in minutes, not days. Updates deep-merge without breaking personal config. `/ticket-scout` flags vague requirements before sprint starts. i18n ships with all languages from day one.

Every session ends with a retro that feeds improvements back into prompts and docs — the self-learning loop that makes the system [adapt to your codebase](#adapt-to-your-codebase) over time.

### [Secure by default — compliance without slowing down](SECURITY.md)

Every PR gets a 7-category OWASP security scan before it reaches a human reviewer. Schema changes require Mermaid diagrams and explicit human approval — agents cannot autonomously change your data model. Quality hooks physically prevent agents from skipping steps.

Three-tier permission ladder — personal sandbox, shared standards, team-enforced lockdown. For regulated industries, security review and change governance are built into the pipeline, not bolted on after.

### [Self-learning — your standards, your pitfalls, your codebase](#adapt-to-your-codebase)

Every bug found, every review comment, every best-practice article your team reads gets baked into agent prompts, coding style docs, and pre-hydrated context. The same mistake never happens twice. Standards stay consistent across every developer and every ticket — human or AI.

Agents that just know "React + .NET" produce generic code. Agents that know **your** serialization gotchas, **your** idempotency rules, **your** permission model produce code that passes review on the first try.

## Repository Architecture

Dream Team Flow is split across three repos:

| Repo | Visibility | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **[dream-team-flow](https://github.com/johwer/dream-team-flow)** | Public | This repo — DTF documentation, improvement plan, `dtf` CLI, company config templates |
| **[marketplace](https://github.com/johwer/marketplace)** | Public | Plugin marketplace — all commands, agents, scripts, hooks, and docs (sanitized) |
| **marketplace-private** | Private | Same plugin files, unsanitized — for team use without de-sanitization |

**Why the split?**
- **Plugin files** (commands, agents, scripts) live in the marketplace repos so any project can install them via Claude Code's plugin system — not tied to Dream Team Flow specifically
- **DTF docs and CLI** live here — framework documentation, improvement plan, company config templates, setup guides
- **Team members** install from `marketplace-private` (real names, no setup needed). **Community users** install from `marketplace` and run `dtf install --company-config` to de-sanitize

---

## How It Works

```
Ticket → Architect → Parallel Dev → Code Review → Test → PR → Human Review → Ship
```

1. **You say:** [`/create-stories`](docs/commands.md#create-stories) `PROJ-1234 PROJ-1235`
2. **Dream Team does:**
   - Fetches all tickets from Jira and **pre-analyzes them in parallel** (scope, complexity, key files, conventions)
   - Presents a recommendations table — you choose Dream Team, Lite, or Just Worktree per ticket
   - Creates git worktrees, installs deps, writes pre-hydrated context files
   - Opens terminals with Claude Code sessions that start with full context
   - Spawns only the agents each ticket actually needs
   - Implements backend and frontend in parallel using a shared API contract
   - Creates a draft PR so the team can follow progress from the start
   - Runs a deterministic quality gate script (formatting, linting, type checks) before every push
   - Reviews the code for security (OWASP) and conventions
   - Polls AI bots (Gemini, Copilot) and CI — fixes issues with a 2-round cap (escalates to user after)
   - PR stays **draft** until you explicitly confirm — then marks ready and assigns reviewers
   - Moves ticket to Done and cleans up

See **[Workflow Phases](docs/workflow-phases.md)** for detailed flowcharts of full, lite, and local modes.

## Features

- **Parallel context pre-hydration** — All tickets analyzed in parallel before sessions start
- **Dynamic team sizing** — Architect spawns only the agents the ticket needs
- **Draft PR from the start** — Created after architecture analysis; stays draft until user explicitly confirms
- **Drift detection** — Build baseline captured before implementation, compared before push — regressions caught locally, not in CI
- **Crash recovery** — Agents write notes to disk; crashed agents respawn with full context
- **Stale worktree cleanup** — Merged/closed PRs detected automatically; orphan worktrees cleaned up before new ones are created
- **Non-destructive PR updates** — PR description edits preserve manually added images and screenshots
- **Jira completion comments** — Ticket creator auto-notified with PR link and summary when work is done
- **Standalone PR review** — `/review-pr` reviews any PR with line-level GitHub comments via API — no local checkout needed. `--full` mode adds local builds, type checks, and test runs for deeper analysis
- **Granular task decomposition** — 5-6 small tasks per agent instead of 1-2 big ones — better progress visibility, checkpoint-level quality enforcement, and less work lost on crashes

See **[Features](docs/features.md)** for the full list — team setup, orchestration, review, resilience, and self-learning.

## Quick Start

### Option A: Plugin Install (recommended)

Install the plugin marketplace and the toolkit:

```bash
# Public (community — needs de-sanitization with company config)
/plugin marketplace add johwer/marketplace
/plugin install claude-toolkit@marketplace

# Private (team — ready to use, no de-sanitization needed)
/plugin marketplace add johwer/marketplace-private
/plugin install claude-toolkit@marketplace-private
```

### Option B: DTF CLI Install (full setup with company config)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johwer/dream-team-flow.git
bash dream-team-flow/scripts/dtf.sh install https://github.com/johwer/dream-team-flow
brew install tmux jq
```

Pass a company config for team installs:

```bash
bash dream-team-flow/scripts/dtf.sh install https://github.com/johwer/dream-team-flow \
  --company-config company-config.json
```

### Option C: Both (recommended for teams)

Use the plugin for commands/agents/scripts, and the DTF CLI for company-specific setup:

```bash
# 1. Install plugin (gets all commands, agents, scripts)
/plugin marketplace add johwer/marketplace-private
/plugin install claude-toolkit@marketplace-private

# 2. Run DTF CLI for company config (sets Jira domain, service names, personal config)
bash dream-team-flow/scripts/dtf.sh install https://github.com/johwer/dream-team-flow \
  --company-config company-config.json
```

See **[Installation](docs/installation.md)** for prerequisites, team/enterprise setup, and supported terminals.

## Usage

```
/create-stories PROJ-1234                        # Full lifecycle — ticket to PR
/my-dream-team --lite <ticket>                   # Claude decides agent usage
/review-pr 1670                                  # Review any PR
```

Three modes: **Full** (multi-agent team), **Lite** (Claude decides), and **Local** (no PR/push). Flags like `--no-worktree` and `--local` can be combined.

See **[Usage Guide](docs/usage.md)** for all modes, flags, PR review, and reviewer auto-assignment.

---

## The Team

11 specialized agents — architect, backend/frontend developers, data engineer, infra, reviewer, tester, visual verifier, and summary writer. The architect analyzes each ticket and dynamically spawns only the agents needed: 2-3 for simple changes, the full team for complex multi-service work.

Read more: **[The Team](docs/the-team.md)** — full agent roster, team sizing logic, and agent definitions.

## Adapt to Your Codebase

Dream Team Flow isn't just configurable — it **learns your codebase** through five learning channels that continuously feed knowledge into agent prompts, coding style docs, and project conventions:

| Channel | Source | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Session retros** | Agents reflect after every ticket | "Handlers should use atomic upserts" |
| **PR review insights** | Patterns from merged PR feedback | "6 PRs had missing i18n — add to quality gate" |
| **Jira pushback scraping** | AI reviewer comment analysis | "Tickets without ACs get 3x more review cycles" |
| **Research & reading** | Internet articles, docs, best-practice guides | Microservices messaging patterns from an online guide |
| **Cross-session analysis** | Pattern detection across retros | "4 sessions mentioned soft delete confusion" |

Every learning flows to the right destination — agent prompts, coding style docs, pre-hydrated context, or command logic. Both humans and AI agents read the same docs, so knowledge compounds for everyone.

**Example:** Your team reads an article on microservice messaging and extracts key patterns — idempotent handlers, no sync calls from event handlers, transactional outbox. Those learnings become:
- A new section in your backend coding style guide (repo docs, via Jira + PR)
- A critical rule in the backend agent's prompt ("every handler MUST be idempotent")
- Pre-hydrated context for any ticket touching message handlers

New team members inherit **everything** on day one — the accumulated knowledge isn't in someone's head, it's in agent prompts, coding style docs, and context files that every session reads automatically.

Read more: **[Self-Learning System](docs/retrospectives.md)** — all five channels, routing rules, destinations, and the compounding effect.

### Tech Stack

Built for monorepos with:
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, RTK Query
- **Backend:** .NET Web API, Entity Framework Core, C#
- **Infrastructure:** Docker Compose, EF Core Migrations

Agent definitions, coding style docs, and context templates are all customizable — swap in your stack, your conventions, your domain-specific rules.
