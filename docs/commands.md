# Commands Reference

All slash commands available in Dream Team Flow.

## Dream Team & Workspace

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/create-stories PROJ-1234` | Full lifecycle — Jira fetch, parallel pre-hydration, per-ticket mode choice, worktree, team launch, PR, cleanup |
| `/create-stories PROJ-1234 PROJ-1235` | Multiple tickets — all pre-analyzed in parallel, then launched sequentially |
| `/my-dream-team <ticket>` | Standalone team — run on an existing branch |
| `/workspace-launch PROJ-1234` | Create a git worktree and start a Dream Team session |
| `/workspace-cleanup PROJ-1234` | Tear down worktree, tmux session, optionally delete branch |

### Flags

| Flag | Effect | Works with |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `--lite` | Claude decides whether to spawn agents or work solo | `/create-stories`, `/my-dream-team` |
| `--no-worktree` | Skip worktree creation, work in current directory | `/create-stories`, `/my-dream-team` |
| `--local` | No PR, no push — stops after review | `/my-dream-team` |
| `--resume` | Resume a paused session from agent notes | `/my-dream-team` |

Flags can be combined:
```
/my-dream-team --lite --no-worktree <ticket>
/create-stories PROJ-1234 --lite --no-worktree
```

### Pause & Resume

| Command | What happens |
|---------|-------------|
| `pause PROJ-1234` | Close for the day — keeps worktree, kills tmux |
| `resume PROJ-1234` | Continue tomorrow — rebuilds context from agent notes |

## Code Review

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/review-pr 1670` | Review a PR with line-level GitHub comments |
| `/review-pr 1670 --full` | Full review — local worktree + builds + deeper analysis |
| `/review-pr 1670 --focus "src/components/**"` | Focus review on specific paths |
| `/review-pr 1670 --no-approve` | Review without approving |

## PR Reviewers

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/reviewers list` | Show configured reviewers |
| `/reviewers add frontend github-user` | Add a reviewer to a category |
| `/reviewers remove infra github-user` | Remove a reviewer from a category |

Categories: `frontend`, `backend`, `fullstack`, `infra`, `data`

PRs stay as **drafts** until the user explicitly confirms. When the user says "ship it", the PR is marked ready and reviewers are auto-assigned based on the ticket scope category.

## Skills

Skills are auto-loaded context injected into the right agent at the right moment — via `autoTrigger` phrases or `skills:` frontmatter in agent definitions. You don't invoke them like commands; they activate automatically or you can call them by name.

| Skill | Triggers on | What it does |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `/triage-issue` | "triage", bug report | Explore codebase → root cause → TDD fix plan → Jira ticket |
| `/design-an-interface` | "design it twice", new service/API | 3 parallel sub-agents with radically different constraints → pick best |
| `/request-refactor-plan` | "refactor plan", "RFC" | Interview → verify → tiny commits → Jira ticket |
| `/tdd` | "tdd", "test-driven" | Red-green-refactor loop — confirms interface before writing implementation |
| `/improve-codebase-architecture` | "improve architecture", "audit" | P1/P2 audit → suggests `/request-refactor-plan` for 3+ findings |
| `/grill-me` | "grill me on X" | Design-tree interview — flesh out ideas before writing code or tickets |

### How skills wire into the Dream Team flow

- **`/my-dream-team`** — suggests `/triage-issue` for bug tickets, `/design-an-interface` for new service/API tickets (pre-flight, non-blocking)
- **`backend-dev` and `frontend-dev` agents** — auto-load `/tdd` via `skills:` frontmatter
- **`/improve-codebase-architecture`** — suggests `/request-refactor-plan` when 3+ P1/P2 findings exist

## Analysis & Learning

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ticket-scout` | Pre-analyze upcoming Jira tickets before sprint planning |
| `/team-review` | Analyze accumulated retro learnings and route them |
| `/team-stats` | Dream Team leaderboard and session history |

## Config & Utilities

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/sync-config` | Push Claude config to GitHub (private + sanitized public repos) |
| `/acli-jira-cheatsheet` | Reference for ACLI Jira CLI commands |
| `/security-setup` | Interactive security configuration (sandbox, deny rules, network) |
| `/security-setup audit` | Audit current security state and tool usage |

## DTF CLI

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `dtf install <URL>` | Clone repo, interactive wizard, symlink into `~/.claude/` |
| `dtf install <URL> --company-config <path>` | Install with company-specific configuration |
| `dtf update` | Pull latest, verify symlinks, regenerate CLAUDE.md |
| `dtf doctor` | Health check — config, symlinks, required tools |
| `dtf contribute` | Export retro learnings as a PR to the shared repo |
